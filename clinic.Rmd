#Question 1: First, the clinic would like to know for which diseases they are seeing patients.
unique(diagnosis$Diagnosis)

#Ans: Anemia ,Breast Cancer,Colon Cancer and Hypertension are the diseases the clinics sees patients 

#1a) Which types of cancer does the clinic see patients for?
only_cancer=filter(diagnosis,IsCancerDiagnosis=='True')
only_cancer
only_cancer_type=distinct(only_cancer,Diagnosis)
only_cancer_type
#only_cancer_type would be the subset which has only cancer diagnosis, will be used for future analysis

#Ans:Breast Cancer and Colon Cancer

#1b) How many patients does the clinic see for each cancer type?

sqldf("SELECT COUNT(*) AS Patient_Count,Diagnosis FROM only_cancer GROUP BY Diagnosis ")

#Ans 22 Breast Cancer patients and 11  colon Cancer patients


#2The clinic wants to know how long it takes for patients to start therapy after being diagnosed, which they consider #to be helpful in understanding the quality of care for the patients
#2a) How long after being diagnosed do cancer patients start treatment for each cancer type?

diff_in_days

final=cbind(final,diff_in_days)
final

#Ans: Final data frame with diff_in_days shows within how many days the patients start their treatment



#2b) Are there any patients which are diagnosed but not treated at the practice?

sqldf("select patientid from only_cancer where PatientID NOT IN(SELECT PatientID FROM treatment) "   )

#Ans From the above query we can see no rows returned, so there are no patients who are diagonised and not treated.

prop


#Ans: From the above query we can see there are no patients with only first line of treatement.
#i.e All the patients went for multiple line of treatment


#Question 4:  How does each drug used at the clinic compare in terms of its duration of therapy?

#Ans: As the single patient is given multiple drugs, I have taken the first drug given date and the last drug given #date for the specific drug type and identified the duration for each drug type for a given patient.

# To conclude, on average the duration for Drug 'A'  56 days, Drug 'B' duration would be 63 days and Drug 'C' 
# duration would be 85 days(we have an outlier so mean will be affected here, we need to take median)
